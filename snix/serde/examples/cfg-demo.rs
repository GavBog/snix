//! This program demonstrates how to use snix_serde to deserialise
//! program configuration (or other data) from Nix code.
//!
//! This makes it possible to use Nix as an embedded config language.
//! For greater control over evaluation, and for features like adding
//! additional builtins, depending directly on snix_eval would be
//! required.

fn main() {
    // Get the content from wherever, read it from a file, receive it
    // over the network - whatever floats your boat! We'll include it
    // as a string.
    let code_loaded = include_str!("foods.nix");

    // Now you can use snix_serde to deserialise the struct:
    let foods: Data = snix_serde::from_str(code_loaded).expect("deserialisation should succeed");

    println!("These are the foods:\n{foods:#?}\n");

    let code_serialized: String =
        snix_serde::to_string(&foods).expect("serialisation should succeed");

    println!("And these are the foods as Nix:\n{code_serialized}");
